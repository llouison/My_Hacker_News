# Databases Homework!

### Create a database

We're just going to use a starter sql file to create our database and tables, and get some seed data set up.

- In this lab directory, there is a `movie_db` directory. In there there's a `seed.sql` file. In your terminal, **MAKE SURE** you are in the `HW_U02_D05_SQL-And-Hacker-News/sql` directory (maybe by running `pwd`??) and then run run:

  ```bash
  psql -f seed.sql
  ```

- After that you should see this output:

  ```bash
  DROP DATABASE
  CREATE DATABASE
  You are now connected to database "intro_movies_db" as user [your username].
  CREATE TABLE
  CREATE TABLE
  INSERT 0 16
  ```

### Check to make sure everything is connected!

Follow these steps:

1. Type `psql` in the terminal. You should see the alternate command prompt.
2. Type `\connect intro_movies_db`. You should see the prompt change to `intro_movies_db=#`
3. Type `SELECT * FROM movies;`

You should see this result:

```bash

### Add some movies!

Refer to the w3school sql cheatsheet section on [insert into](http://www.w3schools.com/Sql/sql_insert.asp). Add the `title`, `release_year`, and `director` of the last 5 movies you've seen that aren't already in the movies table. 

Put your SQL here: 

```sql

INSERT INTO movies
  (title, release_year, director, awards)
VALUES
  ('Inside Out', 2015, 'Pete Docter, Ronnie del Carmen', 'Best Animated Feature Film');
  
INSERT INTO movies
  (title, release_year, director, awards)
VALUES
  ('The Big Short', 2015, 'Adam McKay', 'BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay');
  
INSERT INTO movies
  (title, release_year, director, awards)
VALUES
  ('The Handmaiden', 2016, 'Park Chan-wook', 'Vulcan Award');
  
INSERT INTO movies
  (title, release_year, director)
VALUES
  ('Things We Lost in the Fire', 2007, 'Susanne Bier');
  
INSERT INTO movies
  (title, release_year, director)
VALUES
  ('5 to 7', 2014, 'Victor Levin');

```


### Update some movies!

As you can see, there is a column for `awards` in the `movies` table that hasn't been filled in yet. Refer to the w3school sql section on [update](http://www.w3schools.com/Sql/sql_update.asp) to add an award for five movies in the movies table.

Put your SQL here: 

```sql

UPDATE movies
SET awards= 'Academy Award for Best Picture'
WHERE title = 'Birdman';

UPDATE movies
SET awards= 'Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay'
WHERE title = 'Pulp Fiction';

UPDATE movies
SET awards= 'Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama'
WHERE title = 'Moonlight';

UPDATE movies
SET awards= 'Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay'
WHERE title = 'Fargo';

UPDATE movies
SET awards= 'Academy Award for Best Costume Design'
WHERE title = 'Mad Max: Fury Road';

```

### Delete some movies!

Refer to the w3school sql section on [delete](http://www.w3schools.com/Sql/sql_delete.asp) and delete 5 movies from the list you don't like. Like them all? Add 5 shit movies and then delete those suckers üòù.

Put your SQl here: 

```sql

DELETE FROM movies
WHERE title='The Shining';

DELETE FROM movies
WHERE title='District 9';

DELETE FROM movies
WHERE title='There Will Be Blood';

DELETE FROM movies
WHERE title='Taxi Driver';

DELETE FROM movies
WHERE title='The Red Shoes';

```
