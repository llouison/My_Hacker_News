# Databases Homework!

### Create a database

We're just going to use a starter sql file to create our database and tables, and get some seed data set up.

- In this lab directory, there is a `movie_db` directory. In there there's a `seed.sql` file. In your terminal, **MAKE SURE you are in the `HW_U02_D05_SQL-And-Hacker-News/sql` directory (maybe by running `pwd`??) and then run run:

  ```bash
  psql -f seed.sql
  ```

- After that you should see this output:

  ```bash
  DROP DATABASE
  CREATE DATABASE
  You are now connected to database "intro_movies_db" as user [your username].
  CREATE TABLE
  CREATE TABLE
  INSERT 0 16
  ```

### Check to make sure everything is connected!

Follow these steps:

1. Type `psql` in the terminal. You should see the alternate command prompt.
2. Type `\connect intro_movies_db`. You should see the prompt change to `intro_movies_db=#`
3. Type `SELECT * FROM movies;`

You should see this result:

```bash
 id |          title          | release_year |          director
